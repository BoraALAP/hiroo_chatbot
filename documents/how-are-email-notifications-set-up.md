# How Are Email Notifications Set Up?

In Hiroo, you can choose which email notifications you will receive.

You can make your selections under Settings > Profile > Email Notifications. You can receive email notifications about the following topics:

- **New Applications Arrived**: You can receive email notifications about all the positions you are following, own, or are the Hiring Manager for, or you can turn off these notifications.
- **New Leads Added**: To receive notifications by email when users add potential candidates to the Hiroo Recruitment platform, you can turn on these notifications.
- **Feedback Form Completed**: After a job interview, you can follow up by receiving the interview forms filled out by the recruitment teams via email.
- **New Note Added**: To receive notifications by email about notes added to the Notes section of the Candidate Cards that mention your name, you can turn on this notification.

To set which job listings you want to receive these notifications for, you can add or remove job listings within your authority from the section just below, labeled "Following".

Don't forget to save your settings with the "Save Settings" button after making your preferences.
