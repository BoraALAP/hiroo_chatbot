# Creating and Publishing Job Listings

Creating and publishing job listings is a crucial step in your recruitment journey. This section allows you to define the details of each job posting, ensuring that it accurately reflects the position and requirements.

## Jobs Section

This section serves as a central hub for managing positions within your company. You can view existing job listings, create new ones, and make modifications.

### Search Filter

You can search and filter on the following:
- **Select Team**: Used to filter listings by department.
- **Select Owner**: Filter by the person who created the listing.
- **Select Status**: Filter listings by status (e.g., closed, open-external).
- **Select Location**: Used to narrow down job listings by location.

### Listings

This is where you can view all your listings together. You can see a green color 游릭 next to your open/active listings. Closed positions are indicated with 游댮.

- **Team**: Shows the department the listing is associated with. You can create these teams in the Settings screen.
- **Title**: Shows the job position title. It is recommended to write the most suitable title for the position.
- **Location**: Shows where the person in the position will be located. You can create your company's offices/locations in the Settings section by city and country.
- **Location Type**: Shows the type of location required by the job (e.g., hybrid, remote, or onsite). If you have a different type of location, you can add it in the Settings section.
- **Work Type**: Indicates the type of employment for the position (full-time, part-time, internship). If you have a different type of work arrangement, you can add it in the Settings section.
- **Status**: Shows the current status of the listing (e.g., Open-External/Internal).

## Create a Job

### Create Job Button
This button, located in the upper right corner of the page, allows you to add a new job listing.

When creating a job listing, you can specify the Location Type, Location, Department, and Work Type.

### Job Description Section
This section is also a title section. For example, you can change the title to "Job Description" or write a more fun title according to your company's communication style. The title of the features section can also be changed accordingly.

### Add Description Section
This section is where you will write the job description and desired qualifications. You can write the content in bullet points or plain text.

### Access

### Listing Statuses
Your listings can be in four different statuses:

## Linking a Hiroo Job Listing with LinkedIn

To link a job listing from Hiroo to LinkedIn, first, we need to create a free job listing on LinkedIn.

After entering your company's name, you can start for free and proceed to enter the details of the job listing.

Once you have filled in the information, the part related to Hiroo begins in the next step.

In the next step, LinkedIn presents the option 'Via email' by default. All you need to do is select 'Via an external website' and paste the link of the job listing you want to link with LinkedIn into this section.

You can select the listing related to your career site created with Hiroo and add the URL in this section on LinkedIn as shown in the example below.

After this step, once you publish your job listing, the applications you receive will be collected in Hiroo.

You can manage your candidates, change their stages, and quickly set up meetings.

## I Can't Redirect My LinkedIn Job Posting to Another Site

You've started using Hiroo and want to edit your job posting on LinkedIn to redirect it to a link/career page on Hiroo, but LinkedIn does not allow it.

### Problem 游댮

You likely encountered a screen like this as you were about to publish your listing:

The "Receive Applicants" dropdown menu appears inactive and does not allow you to click. This issue is because you are trying to edit your posting. LinkedIn will not allow you to redirect your posting to another page If you are editing an existing job posting without closing it first, especially if you are using pre-screening questions.

### Solution 游릭

It's quite simple: once you close the posting and create a new one, this section will become active, and you can redirect your posting to Hiroo.

## Creating a Role-Specific Application Form 游꿢

When accepting applications for a job posting, you can use this feature if there are specific questions you want to ask upfront. For example, you can ask a software engineer to include their Github profile when applying, or you can ask a designer to add their portfolio link during the application process.

### Standard "Default Application Form" for Each Position

You can create your standard application form from the Jobs > Application Form step. If you are not going to add role-specific questions, you can create your single form from this step. All the details on how to create this form are included in this article.

Now, we move on to the step of creating different application forms specifically for roles.

### Creating Role-Specific Application Forms

First, we select the Application Form tab from the Jobs page.

In this section, if you have not previously created a second application form, you will clearly see only your single application form.

This form (Default Application Form) is a common application form that you will use for all positions.

To create a new application form, you can click the +Application Form button in the upper right corner.

For example, you can name this form "Software Engineer Application Form" and add questions specific to this position. You can make these questions mandatory or optional. For instance, you can add questions about years of software experience, previous experience with Microservices Architecture, and willingness to work onsite. After adding and saving the questions, you're done here.

### Let's post the job listing

To prepare and share a job listing, start by clicking on Jobs > Create Job button. All the details on preparing and sharing a job listing from scratch are covered in this article.

Let's now use the Software Engineer Application Form we prepared.

Click the +Create Job button in the upper right corner and you will see a dropdown menu where the window for creating our job listing opens with 'Default Application Form' selected.

By clicking on this menu, for example, for a "Backend Engineer" position, you can select the Software Engineer Application Form you prepared, which you previously specified for engineering candidates, bringing up the specific application form you've set for engineering applicants.

Once you select and save the respective form, your job listing will be published with the chosen question form. To verify, click on your company's career page provided by Hiroo (e.g., companyname.hiroo.co). Locate the relevant listing, such as Backend Engineer. When you open the listing and click on the Apply button, you can see how candidates will view this listing and the application form. You can review the added questions from here.

## What is the difference between Hiroo and LinkedIn? 游뱂 

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a powerful social media platform that allows you to network in the professional world. It helps you reach more candidates during the recruitment process and promote your company. With LinkedIn, you can meet potential candidates and build a large talent pool.

### Hiroo

Hiroo is not a platform that replaces LinkedIn; it is a tool that works in integration with it. You can transfer candidates collected from LinkedIn to Hiroo and manage all their recruitment processes here.

By linking any job postings you open in Hiroo to LinkedIn, you increase the visibility of that position. Your career site is merely a tool for you; it is not intended to collect applications on its own. However, when combined with LinkedIn, it helps direct candidates to where you want them to apply.

For the best results, we recommend using Hiroo and LinkedIn together. For more detailed information, you can visit our blog post on our website.
