# Creating Feedback Form Templates for Teams

## What is a Feedback Form?

Feedback Forms, also known as Interview Forms, are forms used by hiring teams to gather feedback about candidates after job interviews. With Hiroo, you can create:

- Different forms for departments (e.g., Marketing Feedback Form, Technology Feedback Form)
- Specific forms for positions (e.g., Software Engineer Feedback Form)
- Forms for different stages of recruitment (e.g., Case Study Feedback Form, Phone Interview Feedback Form)

You have full control of the content of these forms. As the Hiroo team, we create a default form for all accounts we open (Hiroo Feedback Form).

## Default Feedback Form

Setting any form as the Default Feedback Form ensures that this form appears first on the candidate page for all hiring team members, thereby saving time.

If you want to create a General Evaluation form that will be most used in your company, we recommend setting it as the Default.

You can add as many questions to any form as you want, and you can make it mandatory for the hiring teams to fill them out.

## Question Types

You can decide the answer type to the questions you add to your forms:

1. **Single Line**: Used for single-line text answers.
2. **Paragraph**: Used for text entries in paragraph form.
3. **Star Ratings**: Used for responses given with a 5-star rating system. For instance, you could add a question about the candidate's Technical Knowledge and choose this option for the answer.
4. **Yes/No**: Used for questions where a yes/no answer is sufficient. For example, it can be used for the question, "Is the candidate can work from the office?"
5. **Scale Ratings**: Can be used for responses on a scale out of 10. For example, it can be used for general scoring of the candidate.

You can choose whether to fill these questions optionally or mandatorily.
