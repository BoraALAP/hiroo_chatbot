# Setup Phase

Let's kick things off by setting up your company information. This includes creating departments, working types, locations, and location types. Don't worry, we'll guide you through each step. This setup is crucial for your job postings and career site.

We'll start with these topics:
- Set up Company Settings

Once you've completed these steps, we'll move on to configuring your general settings. This includes setting up national holidays to avoid sending emails to candidates on those days and selecting the language preferences for your platform (English or Turkish).

Here's what we'll cover:
- Set your career site's language
- Adding your branding style (Logo, cover image, favicon)
- Linking your social media accounts
- Crafting compelling content about your company, including descriptions and sharing your company culture.

And that's it – you're all set! Ready to make your mark in the world of recruitment. Let's get started! 🚀

## Step 1: Setting up Teams (Departments) & Working Types 

Working with Teams is a great way to organize your entire Hiroo account. This applies to both the recruiters working in your company and the candidates applying for positions. 🗂️

Teams allow you to categorize different departments or divisions within your organization, making it easier to manage job postings, applicants, and internal communication.

Similarly, defining working types helps streamline the recruitment process by specifying the type of employment or contract associated with each position. Whether it's full-time, part-time, or contract-based, setting up working types ensures clarity for both recruiters and candidates. 📋

## Step 2: Setting up Locations and Location Types

Just like departments and working types, setting up locations and location types is key to ensuring a well-organized Hiroo account. 🌍

Locations allow you to specify where your company operates, whether it's multiple offices across different cities or remote work options. By defining locations, you provide clarity to both recruiters and candidates about the geographical scope of your organization. 📍

Additionally, establishing location types helps categorize different types of work environments, such as headquarters, branch offices, or remote locations. This distinction ensures that job postings accurately reflect the working conditions associated with each position. 🏢
