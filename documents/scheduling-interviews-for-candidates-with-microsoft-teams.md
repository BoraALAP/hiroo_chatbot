# Scheduling Interviews for Candidates with Microsoft Teams

## Overview

First, you need to log in with a corporate Microsoft account to utilize calendar and meeting features.

## Step 1: Open Candidate Calendar

After opening the card of the candidate you want to interview, you can open the calendar by clicking the 'Schedule' button on the right.

## Step 2: Select Meeting Details

In the calendar, select the date and time you want to hold the meeting and choose the team member who will be joining the meeting.

Additionally, if you're working on a role that requires multiple interview stages, you can quickly schedule consecutive interviews.

## Step 3: Select Feedback Form

By selecting your feedback form while planning the meeting, you can quickly fill out the template you've prepared during or after the interview, allowing you to keep notes for each candidate.

## Step 4: Manage Scheduled Interviews

You can find all scheduled job interviews with the candidate in the 'Interviews' tab. Here, you can view the times and dates of the interviews, and you can also edit or cancel them if needed.
