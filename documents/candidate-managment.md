## Creating Feedback Form Templates for Teams 📖

From Settings > Feedback, you can create Feedback Forms with various contents for your teams.

 

What is a Feedback Form?

 

Feedback Forms, also known as Interview Forms, are forms used by hiring teams to gather feedback about candidates after job interviews. With Hiroo, you can create:

Different forms for departments (e.g., Marketing Feedback Form, Technology Feedback Form),

Specific forms for positions (e.g., Software Engineer Feedback Form),

Forms for different stages of recruitment (e.g., Case Study Feedback Form, Phone Interview Feedback Form).


 

You have full control of the content of these forms. As the Hiroo team, we create a default form for all accounts we open (Hiroo Feedback Form). 

You may choose to use this if you wish.

 

 


 

Default Feedback Form

 

Setting any form as the Default Feedback Form ensures that this form appears first on the candidate page for all hiring team members, thereby saving time.

If you want to create a General Evaluation form that will be most used in your company, we recommend setting it as the Default.

 

You can add as many questions to any form as you want, and you can make it mandatory for the hiring teams to fill them out.

 

Question Types

 

You can decide the answer type to the questions you add to your forms.

Single Line: Used for single-line text answers.

Paragraph: Used for text entries in paragraph form.

Star Ratings: Used for responses given with a 5-star rating system. For instance, you could add a question about the candidate’s Technical Knowledge and choose this option for the answer.

Yes/No: Used for questions where a yes/no answer is sufficient. For example, it can be used for the question, "Is the candidate can work from the office?"

Scale Ratings: Can be used for responses on a scale out of 10. For example, it can be used for general scoring of the candidate.

 

 


 

 

You can choose whether to fill these questions optionally or mandatorily.

 

Next Step

You can check out how we use the Feedback Forms we created on the candidate page here.

Candidate List:

This page facilitates the tracking of candidates at every stage of the recruitment process, saving time and allowing you to control candidate management from a central point.

## Archived Candidates 🗂️

This section is for the candidates who have completed the recruitment process or have been temporarily excluded from the evaluation. It is used to manage archived candidates and review them when necessary.

 

Page Features:

The menu icon next to each candidate allows you to re-evaluate the candidate, update their information, or completely remove them from the system.

## Adding Notes and Scoring Candidates ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

You have published your job listings and started receiving applications. At this stage, you can use the “Notes” section to assess candidates' suitability for the position.

 

Mentioning a Team Member

You can mention a colleague from your recruitment team by adding the “@” symbol, allowing you to send them a note.

 

For example, "@eda this candidate seems the right fit for the position, could you also check?"

 

This message will send a notification to your team member both within the platform and, depending on email notification settings, via email as well. Thus, recruitment teams can communicate through Hiroo.

 

You can also add notes to yourself without mentioning any team member. As a recruitment team, you can create your own scoring system. For instance, "Let's prioritize candidates we give 5 stars to."

 

 


 

Any note or question you write can be responded to by your team member using the green reply button.

## How to Review Candidates Who Have Applied? 🔎

How to Review Candidates Who Have Applied? 🔎

 

In this article, you can learn about the evaluation process and stages for candidates who have applied for a job.

 

You've posted your listings and want to review candidate applications coming through Hiroo.

 

Candidate Review Stage:

Click on the "Candidates" tab on the left, and then from the "Applications" tab, you can bring up the list of candidates.

 

 


 

 

 

Candidate Card:

 

Each time you click on a candidate application, a candidate card will open on the right. Here, you can see all the information about the candidate in one place.

 

On the Candidate Card Screen, you can find:

Whether the candidate has applied to a listing before

Details of the position applied for, the date, and its current stage

For previously interviewed candidates, the feedback and added Notes

All the answers filled out in the Application Form at the time of application

The candidate’s resume and contact information

All emails sent and planned to be sent to the candidate

Links shared by the candidate (LinkedIn, GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc.)

A record of all actions and activities related to this candidate

GDPR, privacy policy consents

Details of cover letters and much more information are consolidated in this candidate card.

 


 

 

For example, you can preview the candidate’s resume with just one click.

 


 

 

Or, you can quickly access the candidate's shared LinkedIn profile by clicking the LinkedIn icon displayed on LinkedIn.

 


 

Stage Change:

 

Let’s say you have reviewed the candidates and want to move them forward in the process. You can change the "Stage" from the dropdown menu next to the listing where you viewed their application.

 


When you move the candidate from the "New Application" to the "Set Up Interview" stage, the candidate will now be moved under "Interview" on your "Candidates" page instead of under "Applicant." Your candidate will now be considered in the "Set Up Interview" stage on your list of candidates.

 


 

What are the Stages? How are they changed?

 

As the Hiroo team, we understand the needs of HR teams very well and try to provide solutions that could work for all teams. Therefore, when you start using Hiroo, you will encounter the following default stages. These stages meet the interview stages/steps of many companies.

 

Main Stages:

 

 


 

 

POTENTIAL: Shows potential candidates you have reached out to and added to Hiroo. It means they did not come through an application.

APPLICATION: Shows candidates who have come through the application route.

INTERVIEW: Moves all candidates who continue in the interview process, whether they came via applications or were added as potential candidates by your team.

These 3 Main stages cannot be changed. However, we can customize the sub-stages according to your company. Our technical team can support you very quickly in this.

The numbers above the stages indicate how many candidates are currently at that stage.

 

 

Sub-Stages:

 

When you click on each Main stage, it shows the sub-stages that open below. Changes specific to your company can be made. However, it is advised not to make these changes frequently for healthy reporting.

 

POTENTIAL SUB-STAGES

 


 

 

New Candidates: All candidates you add first fall into this section. It makes sense to keep them in this stage if no action is taken.

Reached Out: You decided to reach out to the candidates. After reaching out, it is recommended to move your candidate to this stage. (As mentioned above, just enter the candidate card and change the stage.)

Responses Received: You can move your candidate to this stage when they return a positive/negative response.

 

 

INTERVIEW SUB-STAGES

 

 


 

 

Set Up Interview: You can move candidates you decide to interview after reviewing applications to this stage.

Phone Interview: If your initial interviews are conducted via phone, you can move candidates to this stage.

Office Interview: If your subsequent interviews are conducted in the office, you use this stage.

Case Study: If your recruitment process involves sending a case study or project, you can use this step. This way, you can quickly find out how many candidates are currently in the Case Study stage.

Shortlist: You're advancing candidates in the process, and you are at the decision-making stage. You can use the Shortlist for your remaining candidates.

Offer: You can use this stage for candidates who have moved to the offer stage or have been made an offer.

Hired: You made the offer and your candidate accepted, you can use this stage as the final stage. This stage also serves as an archive.


 

 

Moving candidates to the correct stages will keep your candidate lists up-to-date and facilitate an efficient recruitment process for your entire hiring team.


## How to Use "Filters" When Reviewing Candidates? 🖇️

"Candidates" section where your candidates are listed in Hiroo, you can see all your candidates collectively.

 

In this section, you can see your main stages and the filter icon on the left. The filter section may appear hidden/collapsed as shown in this example.

 


 

 

Or it may appear open as shown here 👇. By clicking the blue Filters button, you can open and close this section. This way, you create more space for yourself while reviewing candidates.

 


 

In fact, you can gain even more space by clicking this small icon 👇 in the left menu of Hiroo. 😉


Let's return to the use of Filters:

   

1.Filtering by Job Postings: In this section, you can filter based on job postings by selecting one or more of your open positions.

 


    

 

2. Filtering by Job Owner: Thanks to the filtering feature by the owner of the position/job posting, in large recruitment teams, the job owner can easily list only their own positions and candidates.



3. Filtering by Last Interaction: With this feature, you can filter candidates with whom you have had no interaction for a long time, ensuring you don't miss them. For example, you can list candidates who have been active but with whom you haven't interacted in the last month.



 

4. Filtering by Location: With this feature, you can filter candidates based on the location responses they provided in the question form.

 



5. Filtering by Source: With this feature, you can categorize your candidates as "Applicants" or "Sourced." For example, if you want to see only the candidates you have reached out to, rather than those who have applied for a specific position, you can use this feature.

 



Finally, while you can use each of these filters separately, you can also apply multiple filters at once.

For example, you can use all these filters together to find candidates for: 1. "Java Engineer" position, 2. Who have applied, 3. With whom there has been interaction in the last 1 month, 4. Located in Ankara. 🥁


Adding an Archive Reason 🗃️

As your recruitment processes evolve over time, your reasons for archiving candidates may also develop accordingly. Hiroo allows your team to customize "Archive Reasons" to meet the changes in your recruitment processes.


However, it is important to remember that frequently changing archive reasons or significantly increasing their number can have extensive impacts on your data in Hiroo. We recommend understanding what archive reasons mean to you and how they function before making any changes.


Default Archive Reasons Provided by Hiroo
When you start using Hiroo, you will see that the most commonly used Archive Reasons are already defined. This information includes:


When you first start using Hiroo, you will see that the most commonly used Archive Reasons are already defined. You can access this information by navigating to:

 

Settings > Company > Archive Reasons




Default Archive Reasons and Their Usage
Underqualified: Used to indicate that the candidate does not possess the qualifications required for the position.

Culture Fit: Used to indicate that the candidate is not compatible with the company culture.

Not Interested: Used to indicate that the candidate did not show interest in the job opportunity.

Potential for Future: Used to indicate that the candidate, while not suitable for the current position, holds potential for future opportunities.

Unresponsive: Used to indicate that the candidate did not respond to communication attempts.

Withdrew: Used to indicate that the candidate withdrew their application.

Offer Declined: Used to indicate that the candidate declined the job offer.

Hired: Used to indicate that the candidate was accepted and hired for the position.


These archive reasons help you systematically record why candidates are either rejected or advanced in your recruitment process.


Rules for Adding Archive Reasons
There are two basic rules here:

You cannot add a reason that has the same name as the archive reasons already provided by Hiroo.

Only authorized users can make changes in this section (only Administrators and Senior Management).

Adding a New Archive Reason
For example, if the default Archive Reasons provided by Hiroo are not sufficient for your company's recruitment processes, you can add a new archive reason.

 


For example, if you want to add a reason named Overqualified (used to indicate that the candidate possesses more qualifications than required for the position).


In the Settings > Company > Archive Reasons section, click on the +Archive Reasons button at the bottom. In the window that opens, enter the archive reason you want to add and save it. From now on, when archiving candidates, this reason will appear in the list. Additionally, in the Candidates section, when you click on Archive and filter, you will start to see this added reason.

## How Can I Add Tags to Candidates? 🏷️

Tag Management: Method 1
By following Settings > Company > Tags, you can create the tags you desire for your candidates.

 


Tag Management: Method 2
In Hiroo, select the candidate you want to tag from the list on the "Candidates" screen. Once you've made your selection, click the "+Tag" button.


From the menu under the button, you can select an existing tag or create a new one.

 


For example, if you see a candidate as a favorite for a specific position, you can save them with the "Favorites" tag.

 

Tag Filtering:

On the Candidates page, you can filter your candidates by clicking on the 'Tag' section in the filters.
