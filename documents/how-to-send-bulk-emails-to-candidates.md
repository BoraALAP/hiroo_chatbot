# How to Send Bulk Emails to Candidates

## Overview

It is possible to send emails to multiple candidates from Hiroo at the same time and to plan when these emails will be sent.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Let's assume you have reviewed new applications. First, go to the 'Candidates' page. Suppose you want to archive the candidates who you think are not suitable for the applied position and send them a rejection email.

### Step 1: Select Candidates
Select these names in bulk and click the '+Archive' button.

### Step 2: Choose Archiving Reason
Choose the reason for archiving. You can find details about archiving reasons in this article.

Then, check the 'Send reject email to candidate' button.

### Step 3: Select Email Template
Select the email template you prepared earlier. You can learn how to create these templates in this article.

### Step 4: Schedule Email
The only remaining task is to determine when your email will be sent.

By clicking the 'Schedule' button, you can select the time frame in which you want to reach the candidate.

Once you save, the selected candidates will be moved to the archive, and the chosen email template will be sent to all of them at the scheduled date.
