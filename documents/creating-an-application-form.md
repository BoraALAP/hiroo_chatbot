# Creating an Application Form 

## Overview

You can determine which information to collect from candidates on your company's career page in the "Application Form" section. All questions added/selected in this section will appear in the application form seen by candidates when they apply to your listings on your career page (e.g., yourcompany.hiroo.co).

> **Note**: In this section, a single application form is created for all positions.

## Sections of the Application Form

The application form consists of three main parts:

1. Personal Information
2. Additional Information
3. Privacy Policy

### Initial Setup

- The initial questions are pre-set by the Hiroo team
- Collecting candidate's name, surname, and email address is mandatory and cannot be modified

## Personal Information Section

This section contains basic information for collecting:
- Contact details
- Resumes

### Customization Options

## Additional Information Section

Collect extra information such as:

**Example**: Add a question like "Do you have a work permit in Turkey?" with a Yes/No response type.

## Privacy Policy Section
