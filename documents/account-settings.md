## Language Settings 🇹🇷🇬🇧

Hiroo offers two language options for users: Turkish and English. Users can choose their language preference to use the platform in either Turkish or English.

 

You can set your language preference in Settings > General. 🇹🇷🇬🇧



Additionally, you can choose the language of your Career Site, Turkish or English, depending on your company's preference. This choice will not affect the language selection of the platform usage. 

You can make this language setting under Career Site Settings > Setup.


## Dark Mode / Light Mode Selection 🌙☀️

You can make a selection to use Hiroo in either light or dark mode from

Settings > General Settings.

Like the language selection, this choice will only affect the user who makes the selection.

 ## What are Holiday Settings? What are they used for? 🏖️

 By adding public holidays to this section, you can prevent emails from being missed.

On these holiday days, emails will not be sent to candidates; any planned emails will be delivered to the candidates on the next business day.
