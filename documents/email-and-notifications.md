## Creating Email Templates ✉️

You can manage ready-made email templates for candidate communication, which saves time for your team. You can prepare templates in advance for the emails you send most frequently (such as interview invitations, negative responses, and case study emails) in the Templates section to accelerate your candidate communication.

### Common Templates

- **Title**: Shows the name of the template. This information is visible only to you and your team.
- **Schedule**: Specifies when the template will be sent (e.g., "Send Now" or after a certain period). This way, you can plan the emails you want to send to candidates in advance.
- **Owner**: Shows who created the template or who is responsible for it.

### Example Templates

*(These examples are automatically set up by the Hiroo team when your account is first opened.)*

- **Applicant Confirmation Email**: An email is sent to confirm the candidate's application. This email assures candidates that their application is being considered with a Thank You note under your company's name. This email is fully automated. The candidate receives this email as soon as their application is received by Hiroo.
- **Application Review: Not Chosen Email**: Candidates receive an email informing them that they have not been selected after their application has been reviewed. This email is not automatic. It should be sent by the user after reviewing the candidate.
- **Phone Call Invitation Email**: An example of an email inviting a candidate for a phone interview. This example can be modified according to your company's language and tone.

Even though these examples have titles in English, you can change them to your company's communication language.

### Create New Template

You can click this button to create customized email templates for your recruitment processes.

- **Title** is for you and/or your team to find easily the template you created. Candidates will not see the title information.
- **From** shows which email account the emails sent to candidates come from. The name that appears in emails seen by candidates will be your company's name, not shown as Hiroo.
- **Subject** shows the subject line of the email to be sent, which the candidates will see.
- **Send Date** plans when this email will be sent by default. For example, if you choose the "4 Days" option, the email will be sent to the candidate 4 days later using this prepared template.
- **Placeholder** allows for personalized messages in bulk emails sent to candidates. For instance, if "Hello {{Applicant first name}}" is selected, the candidate's name will automatically appear.
- **Attach** allows you to create a template for documents you share with candidates. For example, if you are sending a Case Study to the product team's hiring process, you can create a template, attach the document, and save it. This will save time for your team and yourself.
- **Visible/Hidden** allows you to choose whether the templates you create are visible only to you or can be shared with the team. For example, if you are in the recruitment team, you can create templates for your own frequent use.

### My Templates

This section contains custom templates created by the user. If a new template has been created or existing templates have been edited, they will be listed here. 

You can edit templates, adjust timings, and add new templates when needed through this page. Each template can be meticulously planned to ensure effective and timely communication with candidates.

## Email Sync with Gmail 📬

First, to synchronize your emails, you must sign in to your Hiroo account with Google.

To send an email to a candidate, enter the candidate's card and click on **Email > Send Email** buttons in order.

When sending your email, you can select the desired address to reach the candidate by choosing the email you want to communicate with.

Let's say you sent a phone interview invitation to the candidate as in the example below. To track all the conversations with the candidate through your email within Hiroo, click on the three-dot icon and then click on the 'Email Sync' button.

After this step, the candidate's response to your email will also be automatically pulled into Hiroo. This way, you can manage and track your communications with candidates through Hiroo without missing anything!

## How to Send Bulk Emails to Candidates? 📩

It is possible to send emails to multiple candidates from Hiroo at the same time and to plan when these emails will be sent.

Let's assume you have reviewed new applications. First, go to the 'Candidates' page. Suppose you want to archive the candidates who you think are not suitable for the applied position and send them a rejection email.

### Step 1
Select these names in bulk and click the '+Archive' button.

### Step 2
Choose the reason for archiving. You can find details about archiving reasons in this article.

Then, check the 'Send reject email to candidate' button.

### Step 3
Select the email template you prepared earlier. You can learn how to create these templates in this article.

### Step 4
The only remaining task is to determine when your email will be sent.

By clicking the 'Schedule' button, you can select the time frame in which you want to reach the candidate.

Once you save, the selected candidates will be moved to the archive, and the chosen email template will be sent to all of them at the scheduled date.
