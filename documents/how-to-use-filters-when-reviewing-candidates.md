# How to Use "Filters" When Reviewing Candidates

The "Candidates" section in Hiroo allows you to view all your candidates collectively. This guide will walk you through using filters effectively.

## Filter Section Overview

The filter section can appear in two states:
- Hidden/collapsed
- Open (can be toggled by clicking the blue Filters button)

You can create more space by clicking the small icon in the left menu.

## Available Filters

### 1. Filtering by Job Postings

Select one or more of your open positions to narrow down candidate lists.

### 2. Filtering by Job Owner

In large recruitment teams, this feature allows job owners to list only their own positions and candidates.

### 3. Filtering by Last Interaction

Easily find candidates you haven't interacted with recently. For example, list candidates active but not contacted in the last month.

### 4. Filtering by Location

Filter candidates based on location responses from the question form.

### 5. Filtering by Source

Categorize candidates as:
- Applicants
- Sourced

For instance, you can view only candidates you've personally reached out to.

## Combining Filters

You can apply multiple filters simultaneously for precise candidate searching. 

**Example Scenario:**
Find candidates who are:
1. Java Engineers
2. Applied directly
3. Interacted with in the last month
4. Located in Ankara
