# Getting Started with Reports

With Hiroo's Reporting feature, you can obtain comprehensive reports on every stage of your recruitment processes. You can use this data to measure the efficiency of your recruitment processes, identify areas for improvement, highlight key data, and set goals.

The Reporting feature consists of several different reports that provide the data you need to make informed decisions. The reporting feature will continue to evolve over time, and as new reports are added, you will find links to articles that examine the various reports in detail within this main article.

## Reports Overview

First, go to the 'Reports (Beta)' page added to the main menu.

In the Overview section of this page, you can access three different data points: 'Current Candidate Process,' 'Candidate Sources,' and 'Interview Stages.'

### Current Candidate Process

In this section, you can view numerical details about your open job postings, active candidates, archived candidates, your average hiring time, and your offer acceptance rate.

This section displays real-time data, meaning the current status of all positions in Hiroo:

- **Active Job Postings**: Shows how many job postings are currently open
- **Active Candidates**: The number of active candidates who are not archived, are in the interview process, or are waiting after applying
- **Archived Candidates**: How many candidates have been moved to the archive
- **Average Time-to-Hire**: Shows the average time from when candidates enter the process until they are hired, calculated by averaging the time taken for all hires
- **Offer Acceptance Rate**: The offer acceptance rate of the company, calculated based on the total number of hires and offers made

### Candidate Sources

In this section, you can review the source of your candidates based on the time frame you set, displayed graphically as 'Applicants' and 'Contacted.'

#### Date Range Selection
- To select a date range, choose two different dates from the two date fields
- For a quick selection, click the "All Time" button with the calendar icon
- Use the "Add" button on the job posting filter to choose specific positions
  - Open job postings are marked with green
  - Closed job postings are marked with redd

### Interview Stages

In this section, you can find a report regarding the stages where your active candidates are during a specific date range.

You can:
- View candidate numbers in different stages (e.g., Offer stage, Office Interview stage)
- Filter by job postings
- Remove specific roles from the list by clicking the X on the far right of the position row
