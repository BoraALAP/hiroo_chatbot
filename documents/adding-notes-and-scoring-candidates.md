# Adding Notes and Scoring Candidates

## Overview

You have published your job listings and started receiving applications. At this stage, you can use the "Notes" section to assess candidates' suitability for the position.

## Mentioning a Team Member

You can mention a colleague from your recruitment team by adding the "@" symbol, allowing you to send them a note.

For example: "@eda this candidate seems the right fit for the position, could you also check?"

This message will send a notification to your team member both within the platform and, depending on email notification settings, via email as well. Thus, recruitment teams can communicate through Hiroo.

## Creating Notes

You can also add notes to yourself without mentioning any team member. As a recruitment team, you can create your own scoring system. For instance, "Let's prioritize candidates we give 5 stars to."

Any note or question you write can be responded to by your team member using the green reply button.
