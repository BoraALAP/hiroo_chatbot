# What is the difference between Hiroo and LinkedIn?

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a powerful social media platform that allows you to network in the professional world. It helps you reach more candidates during the recruitment process and promote your company. With LinkedIn, you can meet potential candidates and build a large talent pool.

## Hiroo

Hiroo is not a platform that replaces LinkedIn; it is a tool that works in integration with it. You can transfer candidates collected from LinkedIn to Hiroo and manage all their recruitment processes here.

By linking any job postings you open in Hiroo to LinkedIn, you increase the visibility of that position. Your career site is merely a tool for you; it is not intended to collect applications on its own. However, when combined with LinkedIn, it helps direct candidates to where you want them to apply.

For the best results, we recommend using Hiroo and LinkedIn together. For more detailed information, you can visit our blog post on our website.
