# How to Use Candidate Evaluation Automation?

Candidate Evaluation Automation is a tool that automatically evaluates candidates who do not meet the criteria you have set. By defining specific questions and ideal answers for your job posting, you can more quickly and effectively select the most suitable candidates during the application process. Candidates who do not meet your criteria or provide the ideal answers while filling out the application form will automatically be tagged and sent to the archive. Additionally, an automatic rejection email will be scheduled to be sent three days later. Follow the steps below to set up the automation and simplify your screening process.

## What Does It Do?

With this automation, if a candidate's application does not match your specific, non-negotiable criteria, you can move it to the archive without reviewing each one individually and automatically schedule a rejection email. It also allows you to automatically add a tag to your candidates.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Set Up Automation

First, give your automation a title and a description. In the description section, add a brief note about the content and purpose of the automation. For example: "We created this automation to automatically eliminate candidates who do not meet the +3 years of experience criteria." This way, your team members will have more detailed information about the purpose of the automation.

Next, select the job posting for which you want to apply the automation. The application form associated with this job posting will automatically appear, and it cannot be modified from the automation screen.

**Note:** 
- Adding a title to your automation is required for saving it. 
- Optionally, you can write a more detailed description in the 'Description' section.

### Step 2: Define Evaluation Criteria

Select the question from your application form where you require a specific answer. The candidate evaluation automation will work based on the answer you define for the selected question.

For example, if experience with Microservices is crucial for a Backend Engineer role, and you cannot proceed with candidates who lack this experience, you would:
- Select the question
- Mark the ideal answer as 'Yes'
- Candidates who answer 'No' will be deemed unsuitable and moved to the archive

**Important:** The system will only evaluate candidates based on these criteria if the automation is marked as "active" for the job.

### Step 3 (Optional): Add Tags

You can add tags to candidates who give the answer you didn't select when they are moved to the archive:
- Choose from existing tags
- These tags help categorize unsuitable candidates
- Example: Add a 'Junior' tag for candidates not meeting experience criteria

## Sample Questions and Answers

Here are some example automation questions:

1. **Location Question**: 
   - Hire for roles requiring hybrid or office-based work
   - Select specific cities (e.g., Ankara and Istanbul)

2. **Work Permit**:
   - Assess if candidate has a work permit in Turkey
   - Yes/No answer

3. **Education Information**:
   - Filter candidates with Bachelor's degree or higher

4. **University Information**:
   - Select candidates from specific universities

5. **Experience Duration**:
   - Choose valid experience ranges
   - Exclude candidates outside these ranges

6. **English Level**:
   - Require specific English proficiency levels (A1-C2)

7. **Work Style**:
   - Specify work style preferences (Hybrid, Office-based, Remote)

8. **Salary Expectation**:
   - Automatically evaluate based on salary range

## Advanced Automation Rule

Hiroo uses a similarity metric that measures the minimum number of changes required to convert one piece of data into another. This ensures a fair evaluation for similar answers.

### Example

**Question:** What is the programming language you are most proficient in?
**Ideal Answer:** Java

Acceptable variations:
- "Java" (100% compatible)
- "Javax" 
- "Jav"

Not acceptable:
- "J"

## Conclusion

Once you set up your automation, candidates who don't meet the criteria will be:
- Automatically archived
- Categorized with specified labels

This approach enables a more effective and faster candidate evaluation process.
