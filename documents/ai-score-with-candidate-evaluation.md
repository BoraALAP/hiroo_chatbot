# AI Score with Candidate Evaluation

## What is AI Score?

One of the biggest challenges in recruitment is finding the right person among dozens or even hundreds of candidates. Manually reviewing CVs, understanding the details, and making the correct match can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

Hiroo's AI Score feature speeds up and simplifies this process for you. This AI-powered tool analyzes candidates based on their suitability for the position and assigns a compatibility score to each.

## How Does AI Score Help You?

- Quick Evaluation: CVs are analyzed and ranked within seconds.
- Objective Decisions: Eliminates human bias. The evaluation is entirely data-driven.
- Time Savings: Significantly reduces the time spent reviewing CVs, allowing you to quickly identify the best candidates.
- Correct Matching: By ranking the most suitable candidates for the position, it minimizes the risk of wrong hires.

## How It Works?

1. The process starts when a candidate applies to your well-crafted job listing.

2. Hiroo's AI Scoring feature parses the candidate's CV and compares it against the job requirements to perform a compatibility analysis.

3. AI Analysis:
   The AI analyzes candidate information and generates a compatibility score (AI Score) for each candidate, based on a scale of 100.

4. Review the Results:
   You can view applicants ranked by their AI scores and prioritize the most suitable candidates to start the process.

5. If needed, you can filter candidates within specific score ranges using the filter section on the left, making it easier to review and select the best fits for the role.

6. After filtering candidates within a specific score range, you can select them all at once and perform bulk actions from the "Bulk Actions" section. This allows you to easily archive candidates or change their recruitment status in one go, streamlining your workflow.
