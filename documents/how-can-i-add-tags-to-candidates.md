# How Can I Add Tags to Candidates?

## Tag Management: Method 1

By following Settings > Company > Tags, you can create the tags you desire for your candidates.

## Tag Management: Method 2

In Hiroo, select the candidate you want to tag from the list on the "Candidates" screen. Once you've made your selection, click the "+Tag" button.

From the menu under the button, you can select an existing tag or create a new one.

For example, if you see a candidate as a favorite for a specific position, you can save them with the "Favorites" tag.

## Tag Filtering

On the Candidates page, you can filter your candidates by clicking on the 'Tag' section in the filters.
