# Adding an Archive Reason 🗃️

## Overview

As your recruitment processes evolve over time, your reasons for archiving candidates may also develop accordingly. Hiroo allows your team to customize "Archive Reasons" to meet the changes in your recruitment processes.

However, it is important to remember that frequently changing archive reasons or significantly increasing their number can have extensive impacts on your data in Hiroo. We recommend understanding what archive reasons mean to you and how they function before making any changes.

## Default Archive Reasons Provided by Hiroo

When you first start using Hiroo, you will see that the most commonly used Archive Reasons are already defined. You can access this information by navigating to:

**Settings > Company > Archive Reasons**

### Default Archive Reasons and Their Usage

1. **Underqualified**: Used to indicate that the candidate does not possess the qualifications required for the position.
2. **Culture Fit**: Used to indicate that the candidate is not compatible with the company culture.
3. **Not Interested**: Used to indicate that the candidate did not show interest in the job opportunity.
4. **Potential for Future**: Used to indicate that the candidate, while not suitable for the current position, holds potential for future opportunities.
5. **Unresponsive**: Used to indicate that the candidate did not respond to communication attempts.
6. **Withdrew**: Used to indicate that the candidate withdrew their application.
7. **Offer Declined**: Used to indicate that the candidate declined the job offer.
8. **Hired**: Used to indicate that the candidate was accepted and hired for the position.

These archive reasons help you systematically record why candidates are either rejected or advanced in your recruitment process.

## Rules for Adding Archive Reasons

There are two basic rules here:

- You cannot add a reason that has the same name as the archive reasons already provided by Hiroo.
- Only authorized users can make changes in this section (only Administrators and Senior Management).

## Adding a New Archive Reason

For example, if the default Archive Reasons provided by Hiroo are not sufficient for your company's recruitment processes, you can add a new archive reason.

If you want to add a reason named "Overqualified" (used to indicate that the candidate possesses more qualifications than required for the position):

1. Go to **Settings > Company > Archive Reasons**
2. Click on the **+Archive Reasons** button at the bottom
3. In the window that opens, enter the archive reason you want to add and save it

From now on, when archiving candidates, this reason will appear in the list. Additionally, in the Candidates section, when you click on Archive and filter, you will start to see this added reason.
