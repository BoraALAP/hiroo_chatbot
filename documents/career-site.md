## Creating an Application Form üìã

### Section: Jobs > Application Form

You can determine which information to collect from candidates on your company's career page in the "Application Form" section. All questions added/selected in this section will appear in the application form seen by candidates when they apply to your listings on your career page (e.g., `yourcompany.hiroo.co`).

In this section, a single application form is created for all positions.

This section consists of three parts:
1. **Personal Information**
2. **Additional Information**
3. **Privacy Policy**

> **Important**: The initial questions you see on this page and whether they are mandatory/optional, visible/hidden have been pre-set by the Hiroo team.
>
> Since collecting the candidate's name, surname, and email address is mandatory during the application, this section cannot be modified. You can make any changes to all other questions.

### Personal Information

This section contains basic information where you can collect candidates' contact details, resumes, and current company information.
- You can hide/show or make questions mandatory/optional using the toggle switches next to the questions.
- You can change the order of questions by dragging them using the six-dot icon next to each question.

You can add as many new questions as you want to this section. You can select the response format for these questions from the dropdown list next to each question. The format of responses to the questions you add can be any of the following:

| Response Format | Description |
|----------------|-------------|

| Telephone number format | For phone number validation |
| Web address, URL format | For website links |

For example, you could add the question "Do you have a work permit in Turkey?" and select Yes/No as the response type.

### Privacy Policy

This section is created to ensure that candidates are informed about GDPR issues during the application process, to obtain their consent on GDPR issues, and to log this information. You can add links related to your company's policies and GDPR texts in this section to obtain consent during the application.

If you decide to use this section, it is recommended to make it mandatory. This way, candidates can give their consent by checking the checkbox before applying.
