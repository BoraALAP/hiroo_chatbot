# Step 2: Setting up Locations and Location Types

Just like departments and working types, setting up locations and location types is key to ensuring a well-organized Hiroo account.

Locations allow you to specify where your company operates, whether it's multiple offices across different cities or remote work options. By defining locations, you provide clarity to both recruiters and candidates about the geographical scope of your organization.

Additionally, establishing location types helps categorize different types of work environments, such as headquarters, branch offices, or remote locations. This distinction ensures that job postings accurately reflect the working conditions associated with each position.

Let's continue to fine-tune your Hiroo account by setting up your locations and location types. Once completed, you'll have a comprehensive overview of your organization's footprint, making it easier to manage recruitment efforts across different areas. Ready to get started? Let's go!
