# Creating a Role-Specific Application Form

When accepting applications for a job posting, you can use this feature if there are specific questions you want to ask upfront. For example, you can ask a software engineer to include their Github profile when applying, or you can ask a designer to add their portfolio link during the application process.

## Standard "Default Application Form" for Each Position

You can create your standard application form from the Jobs > Application Form step. If you are not going to add role-specific questions, you can create your single form from this step. All the details on how to create this form are included in this article.

Now, we move on to the step of creating different application forms specifically for roles.

## Creating Role-Specific Application Forms

First, we select the Application Form tab from the Jobs page.

### Steps to Create a New Application Form

1. Click the +Application Form button in the upper right corner.
2. Name the form (e.g., "Software Engineer Application Form")
3. Add position-specific questions
   - You can make questions mandatory or optional
   - Examples include:
     - Years of software experience
     - Previous experience with Microservices Architecture
     - Willingness to work onsite

### Posting a Job Listing

1. Click Jobs > Create Job button
2. Select the specific application form for the position
   - For example, for a "Backend Engineer" position, choose the Software Engineer Application Form

### Verifying the Application Form

- Check your company's career page (e.g., companyname.hiroo.co)
- Open the job listing
- Click "Apply" to review the custom application form
