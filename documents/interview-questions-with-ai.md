# Interview Questions with AI

## What are Interview Questions with AI?

A successful interview starts with the right questions. However, preparing suitable questions for each position can be time-consuming. From technical skills to cultural fit, missing the right question in an interview can lead to a bad hire.

Hiroo's AI-Powered Interview Questions feature analyzes the position requirements and suggests personalized questions for you. This makes your interviews more effective, focused, and result-driven.

## How It Works?

1. Go to the Hiroo Job Listings section.
   - You can create a new job listing by clicking the "Create Job Listing" button and generate questions for it.
   - Alternatively, you can also generate questions for a job listing you've already created.

2. Assuming you have a well-designed job listing, proceed by entering the details of the relevant job listing and click the "Interview Questions" button.

3. The more detailed and well-designed sections like Job Description and Desired Qualifications in your listing are, the more accurate and precise your Interview Questions feature will be.

4. If you haven't generated any questions for this listing before, you will see a notification on the screen. By clicking the "Create Questions" button, you can generate the questions in just seconds.

5. The AI analyzes the job description and generates questions based on the requirements. It provides you with questions considering the following criteria:
   - Technical Skills related to the position
   - Core Competencies (e.g., Analytical Thinking, Communication, Leadership) to measure these skills
   - Motivation and Cultural Fit to assess alignment with the company and role

6. The AI will compile all the questions into a PDF file. You can download this file to your computer or print it if you prefer.

7. If a question set has been created for a position, other users can access it without generating new questions. However, with each new question set creation, the old questions will be replaced.

8. Prepare for your interviews by reviewing the suggested questions and, if necessary, editing them to be ready for your interviews.
